51,"one in every fifteen items of retailer clothing fits. this jacket is one. easy to grab and keep chill away. hood snuggles up as cozy collar when not worn up. model in photo must have orangutan arms, sleeves hit at wrist on this wearer with shortish arms.boiled wool fabric is light, which is great for layering. lovely transition fall to winter transition piece. statement jacket that will live on next season and beyond.thank you, rosie neira.",5,1,0
32,"the designshape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.dear retailer  please make sure that you do not send preowend clothing articles to",2,0,0
57,"i purchased this top i thought of it as a sweater to wear for a chilly holiday in mn. it is super flattering and i think it would be on anyone! my 28 year old daughter saw it on me and claimed at a christmas present so i just ordered another. we have very different body types but the neckline made us both look very elegant and it is super comfortable. i have not seen how it cleans, yet. we both got the lighter colored one...love!",5,1,5
46,"this runs sooo big! i normally wear a large  145lb, 54, 36dd but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered could have fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern, color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i do not want to look like i am wearing a tent, lol. also, the back is slightly longer than the front, something i could not see from the pictures online.",1,0,2
57,"purchased the gray patterned top. seemed to fit tts, but it did not fit me. i am an athletic build with a 34d bust and it just would not fit right around the shoulderneck area. i am pretty confident it would fit someone who is less busty than i. the doublesided fabric was soft and felt like it would washwear very well. nice length all around...top and sleeves.",3,0,0
39,this dress brought out my tamed inner kittythere is a collar so of course it is tamed! i am in love with this unique print that roars retailer to all who admire. this is not a hot weather dress because of long sleeves and fabric. dropped stars cuz it is yucky polyrayon and you need to size down or you will be drowning in fabric this cat does not swim! looks great belted or underneath my black wool sweater. i am 53 135 36c and i purchased size 8.,4,1,0
74,"i am 57 and weigh 123 lbs. i tried on both these dresses in medium, and they both fit. they are not too thin, not too high slit, not scratchy. the problem is i am middle aged with a thick waist. the waist looked lumpy with the close fit knit. if you are younger, slim and tall, you will love it. i sent it back with regrets. hope this helps.",4,1,0
42,"i was looking for a new springsummer tee that still gave coverage for chillier mornings and nights and this is it. it has a nice swing to it that is not too wide think a flattering aline cut that has some movement towards the bottom hem. it is fitted and flattering where it needs to be the shoulders and ribcage run fitted and tts which means you do not get lost in the top. it is not boxy or oversized, but if you want a fitted and more flattering look, you can definitely size down easily, parti",4,1,2
52,"i was looking for a lightweight top to wear with black linen trousers to a party, i was not sure of this top seeing it on a slender model i am a more typical 50 year old mom body and i have never worn a peplum style. i put it on for my husband and approved, so i wore it. i received many compliments  a few from good friends who congratulated me for going out of my comfort zone with the style!",4,1,0
35,this shirt is as cute on as it looks in the pictures. i love the fit and felt great in it on a moms night out with jeans and heals. i also think it could be dressed up for work or further down for a day out and about! love it!,5,1,0
31,"this dress looks and feels cheap. the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely. the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking. overall, a pretty horrible dress. save your money,",1,0,0
37,"i agree with the first reviewer exactly. beautiful fabric and idea of dress looks stunning on model, but huge and shapeless in person like a tent. not at all what i expected when ordering a 2 petite. sadly, has to be returned.",1,0,3
48,loose fitting and comfortable without losing its shape. looks great on. the tie in front adds to the dress. i love to wear with tan kneehigh boots.,5,1,0
31,"adorable peasant fitting top.  not too voluminous, just right for over jeans, and really cute with shorts.  the detail makes it wearable for dress up or down, and the cut is classic!",5,1,1

41,i ordered the large since the med was not available and it did not complement my figure because it was too loose all over. i like the design detail with offcenter buttons and the fabric is a nice quality.,3,0,0

55,i have this top in both the green and blue and live them both. the back of this top is so cute and makes the whole top.the embroidery  is cute too.,5,1,0
31,"this top is really beautiful. the color is rich and the texture on the back is a unique touch. and i think it might have worked for me except that i could only find a ml and it was just too big. i love drapey styles and think this top would have been just the right amount of drapey if i would been able to snag a smaller size. but the ml looked like a teal sack, so it is going back.",3,1,0
39,"these are soft, silky, and super comfortable, the fit is very flattering, especially with muscular legs. beautiful pattern and colors, fit like a glove. however, unfortunately, they felt like pj pants, i know they are beach pants, but they were pretty seethrough. for the price, i decided to return and wait for potential sale... ps i needed heels as they are long if you usually get petite.",4,1,4
60,"there is so much going on on this dress  it is fantastic. hard to tell from pics  but there is a peekaboo lattice detail going down the front and back of the sleeves. the beading is plentiful but not too much for work. dress is significantly longer on me than the model  i am 56, but still a tad above the knee. with tall boots or booties and tights, this will go straight from work to out for the evening. i am real long waisted  originally ordered m, but exchanged for l. much better fit overa",5,1,2
41,"i purchased this beauty in the sophisticated dark green on black friday and it has been in constant rotation. it looks chic and classy, feels comfortable and warm. i only wish it was about 2 inches longer, i am 55 and it hits at low thigh, i prefer just above the knee for a winter dress. very practical for walking around city all day and then being ready for a dinner or drinks in style. love it.",5,1,0

39,"i ordered the skirt on friday and it arrived on monday. my expectations were exceeded. the fabric is great quality and there are subtle flecks of gold throughout. the fabric is substantial but not stiff at all  for this type of skirt, you need a thicker fabric. i am about 54, 123lbs and i ordered a 2 regular. the fit  everything from the length to how it fell on the hips, is perfect. cannot wait to wear this skirt!",5,1,0
38,"this is the widest sweater i have ever seen. i laughed out loud when i opened it, and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too. it is comically wide. even when i was 912 months pregnant, the ml would have been pretty roomy on me. now that i am back to about a size 1012, this looks like jared from subways preweightloss pants, in sweater form. ridiculous!",2,0,1

41,"i really liked this dress in pictures online. i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays. everything about this dress was a disappointment, especially at this price point. the fit was weird tight in some places, too loose in others i am usually xs or s, i ordered this one is s. it is made out of a fairly thick and warm material, yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures, especially in the back, making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck, upper b",2,0,3
32,"i love the design of this dress, but found it to be an odd fit. the bow in back did not cover my bra, and in fact, though the overall fit seemed right, the bust was tight unless i removed the bra which is not an option in my book. i am not largechested, so this seemed like a design flaw to me.",3,0,0
37,i purchased this based on previous reviews. the quality of the dress and the print is excellent. the dress fit me perfect in the front however there were so much extra fabric in the back that it made me look extremely large. i understand it is a shirt dress however the back would need to be taken in like 6 inches. for someone who is looking for a more boxy full coverage dress this is more for them,4,0,2
43,"i am addicted to these dresses! as usual, the detail is amazing and the shape is so flattering.as some reviewers mentioned, the dress is much more brown than shown on the picture so if you are looking for a black dress, there are others in the collection that are much better. otherwise, gorgeous dress.",4,1,0
42,"i wanted to love this sweater. the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful. however when i put it on, it added at least 20 pounds to my frame. unfortunately it is going back since the cut just does not work on my frame.",2,0,1
33,"these leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy, sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size i wear a size 6medium28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great.",5,1,0
39,"i tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun, and who donset want a pair of comfycute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i do not think the cut will be falttering on 99 of the population. also, not as comfortable as they looked, the crotch seemed a little low on me, though the pants were in the correct size.",3,0,7

24,"this is a nice shirt, but i cannot keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am usually wear 00 petite in all pants and i think this size was perfect fit across the back perfectly when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time, the high low styling makes for a really strange shirttail in the back. i am sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute",2,0,3
52,the online picture does not do this skirt justice. it is very pretty and unique in design. i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture. this is truly a pretty pencil skirt.,5,1,7
32,i bought the mauve color and it is very pretty. i felt as though sizing up was a better choice. i am usually an xs or a small and i went with the small. i liked the length of the small better. the shoulders add a cute look to it.,5,1,0
39,"i cannot say how much i love this dress. i purchased it in midnovember and i am wearing it for the 4th time this evening, which prompted me to write a review. it fits tts. the stomach area is slightly unforgiving, but due to the dark color, it is not at all a deal breaker. plus, it is a great dress to wear with opaque tights, which solve the tummy issues as well. what i love most about this dress is its ability to go from day to nightless formal to more formal. it looks great with edgy black ankl",5,1,0
59,"the top i received was large, really long in length, pockets in the front along the seam, and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape. the id s matched, but that is about it. returned!",1,0,1
47,"this oversized sweater is lightweight and scratchy. i knew it would fit big, but the neck is overly bulky. the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture. fits a little larger on me than on the model. i am petite so it overwhelmed me.",2,0,0
30,i loved this skirt on the rack. but it was not lined and super scratchy when worn. i could barely wear it for the length it took to try it on. so sad. such a gorgeous skirt.,2,0,2
51,i saw this on one of the gals at my local retailer and fell in love. it is the coolest bomber and i instantly fell for it. i went with my normal l and i will be wearing this all fall and winter long it is just so unique and eye catching,5,1,10
44,"such a pretty fall sweater. nice fit. wore it once out shopping and it snagged  had to return, sadly.",2,0,0
62,i really like this shirt. the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt. it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt. it is a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater.,4,1,1
59,"the photo of the mila turtleneck where model has her hands to her sides, and just below her hair, there is a bit of extra fabric which falls to the bottom of the sweater in a bit of a pleat well, it is not representative of the abundance of fabric in the xl. i usually wear an l or xl well with retailer clothing. the excess added the appearance of excessive pounds from breasts to bottom of sweater. bummer. i will be returning it.",2,0,3
38,this top was very cute but super short and i am a short waisted petitie personthe waistline hits above your belly button looks very silly.,1,0,1

51,"love this top! got it in white for a recent trip to paris  felt chic and cool during a bit of a spring heat wave in the city of lights. it runs somewhat small  i am 57, 128 lbs, broad shoulders, and got the 6. my usual 4 fit but was a little snug. i would recommend going up in size in this style. the 6 looked better because it is supposed to be a boxy, swingy top.",5,1,1
54,im not crazy about maxi dresses so when i found this fun print with fringeit spoke my language. love this dress. feel this dress will work with many seasons. dress falls nicely and feels comfortable. i was worried it would be too long but with a 2 inch heelits perfect. have paired it with some red dangled earrings that spice it just right.,5,1,0
56,"pros pretty, nicely made.cons the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting, and the blouse cuts in under the arms. i do not mean that it is tight or digs in, but it cuts in you cannot tell in the angle of the photo. the blouse is short as well, and, as i am curvy, it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure.",3,0,5
67,"this is truly a lovely dress. the colors are beautiful and i love the contrasting but complimentary fabrics which add interest to an already elegant dress. the material is substantial without being stiff so that it flows gracefully and it flatters the figure.in my opinion if fits true to size, i am 32b, 5 and 103lbs and i got it in a 2p which is the size i normally get in dresses. it is slightly more loose than other retailer dresses in the same size but it still follows your curves without being",5,1,0
42,i tried the yellow striped dress on in the store and it is completely sheer.,3,0,7
60,i just received this jumpsuit and was so excited.  unfortunately it is too small and will have to go back.  the top is so cute and the material is thick so no need for a bra which i really liked.  it runs short in the stride and also in the top.  i ordered a petite since i am only 50 tall and was very surprised how short the stride was.  the length was great and would love to have been able to kept it.,4,1,0
38,"i love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber, which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern so cute! it is slightly short on my 58 frame so the shirt tail hems peeked",5,1,1
73,"i walked into a hair salon wearing this dress, and everyone who walked by complimented me. to me, that is a definite winner! i got the blue color, and the various colors in it are vibrant and lively. the underdress is like a full slip and an added bonus. this probably also makes the dress hang the way it should. there is no static or clinging where there should not be. i was afraid i might be too short to pull this off, but i absolutely love it.",5,1,0
46,"if you can get over the fact that this skirt feels and looks awfully similar to the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then, it is surprisingly fun to wear.",3,1,0

40,"this dress is gorgeous. it is somewhat fitted but i did not find it to run small. i am top heavy 36d and usually wear a size 10, but i bought this in an 8 and it fits me great. i will say the zipper is a bit tricky. at first i thought the dress was too tight but it turned out the zipper was stuck. after fiddling with it, i realized the dress fit but the zipper was a bit tricky. i wore it to work and got so many compliments. also the picture makes the background look burgundy but it is mostly blac",5,1,1
37,"i was so excited to receive this shirt and so disappointed when i tried it on. it is a lot fuller than it looks in this picture or maybe it is because i ordered a large? i am 58, 180lbs, 36d bra size and can fit into a large at retailer just fine but it made me look huge! not flattering at all and it was so full that it looked like a short dress!",3,0,10
46,this top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides. it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric. clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her. it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it is going back.,3,0,6

25,"i have other stevies, and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist, approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally, the cuff is sewn like that in place, and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like, a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!",1,0,1
34,"no need to be on the fence about this top, it is lovely! what you see pictured here, is exactly what you get, even the color of the top is 100 accurate. for reference i am usually an xl16, apple shape, 40 c bust, and this xl does not cling at all to me, so you may even be able to size down. the drape of the clipdot fabric is flattering, and thick enough not to need a cami. all of the fabrics used are nice and soft... and the details! it is going to be a beautiful spring!",5,1,16
24,i like the look of this tee and the fit is fine but it is described as a cottonrayon jersey and in fact it is 50 polyester. i would not have ordered if i had known and now have to take it back.,3,0,0
26,"i love dark colors and i loved the summer touch to this top that i feel like i can wear it year round! the little anchors on the buttons are such a cute touch very retailer. it does run slightly smaller, but not in an extreme way. i would love to see more styling options for this top because i am a little stumped at how to wear it outside of my white high waisted shorts, haha.",5,1,1

25,i fell in love with this dress as soon as i came across it online. ordered the dress in a large and it fit perfectly. i am smaller on top and larger at the bottom pear shaped. the dress fit well and hid all of my flaws. only problem was that it wrinkled very easily and i am wondering if i received a dress that was sitting around for awhile since it was covered with lint and white fuzz when i received it in the mail. other than that the design was absolutely beautiful with incredible embroidery.,4,1,0

30,i recently bought this top in both the black and blue motifs and love it! i am currently 7 months pregnant and this top provides great coverage for the bump. i agree with another reviewer that noted that it is a little tight in the bust as i had to go up a size for that reason.,5,1,0

34,omg  i laughed so hard after i put these on. i was so excited to get them. i ordered them in my usual 4. i got a little suspicious when i pulled them out and noticed they had an elastic waist band.they were a little too small for me and even if they were not it is hard to imagine a world in which they did not make me look like an oompa loompa or a hobbit! they are beautifully made and i kept looking at the picture and wondering why they do not look like that on me? i definitely have a curvier sh,3,0,1
