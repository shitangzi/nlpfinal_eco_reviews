0,37,a great little dress that can be dressed up or down.,5,1,0
1,44,"i found this in store last weekend and thought it was it perfect. i got the size small which had plenty of space for me, usually a 46 or small 34a2826.it is long, i found it to be just below knee length 56.if you zoom in, you can see some detail work along the front edges which complements the pretty openwork in back.it has pockets too by the way this will be worn over everything this summer, let us hope the polyrayonspandex blend washes ok!",5,1,8
2,32,"i bought one of these as a gift for a friend and i loved it so much i had to get one for myself! it is beautiful material and has lovely detail, a little sheer so best worn with a cami underneath. probably better for those with not too ample busts as it does not have a lot of stretch.",5,1,0
3,54,"i love this tunic, the detail the weight, the fringe. but it runs big. i would have done better to have ordered one size smaller. i think it would have looked more tailored if i had gotten the medium.",4,1,2
4,58,i got this in the color listed as pink. it is not a usual pink. the fit is goodnot too tight and not too loose. the length is good for a tee.,5,1,3
5,54,"i purchased a large and it fit perfect. i am a size 12 36dd. the material is very forgiving and flows over my curves. thick enough that it does not need a slip and will stretch to fit size 14 ladies, maybe size 16 too. i am 57 and the length is great on me with flat sandals. does not show my bra either.",5,1,2
6,23,"i did not purchase because it was too low cut for my liking, but otherwise really liked this top. i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 383040 for reference",4,1,5
7,21,"i bought this dress after eyeing it up for weeks  it is really stunning. the red is incredibly vibrant, especially for linen, and the construction is very highquality. since it is linen, it feels crisp and light, and you can layer it up nicely with a pullover or roll up the sleeves for flatout hot days. the rayon slip is a really nice touch, too, since the linen is fairly transparent. it really drove home the sense of quality for me. i bought mine in size 0regular, which i found slightly big i",5,1,0
8,48,"i purchased this online without seeing in person and was pleasantly surprised. i have purchased clothing made from netting with embroidered damask design in the past and found them to be stiff and scratchy, however, this is soft with some stretch that makes it very comfortable to wear. the fit in person is more form fitting than pictured and is quite flattering. another nice design element is while the she will appears to be see through, there is a built in strapless nude cami attached inside. over",4,1,2
9,32,"i was eyeing this one for a while. based on the style and other reviews, i did order one size up. i think it would have been too small catch on the hips in my regular size. i do wish it was a little longer, too. the back is fine because it is longer. it is definitely wearable though. i would not recommend it for a work function if you are a bit taller. despite all of that, i really do like dress. it is a new favorite. i ordered the blue  love the dot pattern. i wore it with brown booties and it",4,1,0
10,24,let me just say that this material is awesome!!! when i first took it out of the packaging i was afraid that the top was too thick of a material but after wearing it around the house it seems light enough. i live in a warm area. i will say that i find the top to be a bit larger. i ordered a medium in fear that the small would be too small on the bottom. i could have taken the small in the topeven though it is meant to be baggy  the bottoms on the medium fit me great they shorts do not b,5,1,1

12,65,"this is the kind of blouse you want at your reach when dressing on a humid day. cotton enhanced with beautiful detail. a very classic timeless, ageless piece. i bought the medium, which fits perfectly size 8 top, 34f. my only ding is that the neck opening should be stitched less deep there is a gap. funny thing is that, in the photo, the models blouse is pinned exactly where i am talking about. i did not take off a star because i had a dressmaker fix the problem, but this was annoying. i wore",5,1,10
13,43,this bra is beautiful. the lace is so lovely and soft and looks fabulous on. my only criticism is it runs very small. i am a 32 a and order the size 1 and it is snug... just order a size up or two and it should be perfect.,4,1,0
14,77,"i agree with the other review that the dress runs big and long, but i love it! it is very flattering and i have super high wedges that work great with it. i do not think it runs super big but it is slightly big. definitely size down if small busted. i wore it out and got a ton of compliments. it is classy, different and hot!",4,1,0
15,58,"i saw this dress in the retailer store and fell in love with it. tried it on, and even though i was wearing jeans and desert boots, the dress looked terrific! it is great, can obviously be dressed up or down, a wonderful addition to my wardrobe! thanks retailer!",5,1,0
16,54,"hi, this top is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. very feminine. it has a small amount of swing without a large amount of fabric. love it.",5,1,1
17,67,"i bought these on sale and they quickly went back. i was very disappointed after reading the reviews. i thought for sure these would be a winner. however, i was sadly mistaken. i ordered another pair of jeans, the same, from a different brand. these were way too small while my others were too large. they did not live up to my expectation and were still rather long. even though i bought these on sale, i was not happy with the quality.",1,0,0

19,41,"this sweater is a pretty color and style and is really soft and comfortable  i really wanted it to work. a small fit my 57, 140 lb frame well 32dd but the ruffles on the hips were not a wanted addition unfortunately. . tried it on three separate times to try to change my mind but in the end, it is going back. i would not suggest it if you have an athletic or hourglass figure with even a little hip.",4,0,3
20,41,i was excited about this   such a lovely look online. but on me...it was just meh. i am a little heavy right now so that could be playing into it...but i will say i loved the top part of the dress. very flattering and subtly sexy. but the bottom..it just hangs like a rag. it needs either more material for a swishier effect...or it needs to be a different material. or maybe knit just does not work on me in the form of a dress! the knit is nice but i kind of also feel like it is chintzy...i cannot,3,0,1
21,49,"love this shirt, the material the design... but....i have not worn it yet... the side openings are strategically placed to show my least flattening angles, if you know what i mean. i will be sewing these two openings and hope the shirt still looks and fits beautiful.",4,1,0
22,47,"these culottes are fun. i bought the neutral color with the black stripes in xs. in my opinion, they run big. i am usually a small 46, 31 waist, 38 hips. pleats at the hip and low waist area are not always my friend, but with a longer tank or shirt, they looked fine. the fabric moves in a graceful way and these culottes can be dressed up or down. so far, wrinkling is not a huge problem but we will see. i am 5 9 tall and these fall about the same place on the modelmid calf. they looked grea",4,1,1
23,48,"i ordered a large and despite wearing a large in many other items from antrhopologie, this item was too small, especailly across the bust. it was very wellmade and the color green is beautiful, but unfortunately, i will not be able to wear it. so disappointed.",2,0,0
24,43,"i tried this on in the store, but almost did not because i thought it would look like a sack. the dress looks so good. it fits nicely in the shoulders which gives structure and then the rest of the dress is roomy, but no so much it looks stupid. i am 55 and it hit above my knees by an inch or two.",5,1,15
25,26,"the dress immediately caught my eye in the store. upon trying it on, i discovered that the slip runs extremely small and unnecessarily so considering the looseness of the shift. the skirt is a tad longi am 56 and it hits midknee. it is a shame the slip was so tighti loved the dress otherwise.",3,0,0
26,41,"i have had my eye on this dress ever since i saw it in a fall catalog. my daughters name is tegan and this is exactly the style i love  simple. when it went on sale i was lucky enough to find it in the green color i wanted at a great price. it is so soft and comfortable, yet flattering. it is a must have. now i want to get this in black!",5,1,0
27,40,i own 45 other cloth and stone tops and always love the softness of the material. this one missed the mark. not soft and very thick. not what i was expecting.,2,0,3
28,39,"awful color, horribly wrinkled and just a mess...so disappointed",2,0,1
29,26,"this dress is beautiful as pictured on the model. but on me, not so much. i am normally a size 000 with a 32b bra size. i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy. i also thought the material was going to be thicker, but it was very thin and did not seem to fall right on my body. beautiful design, just not the right material or fit.",3,0,0
30,39,"these are soft, silky, and super comfortable, the fit is very flattering, especially with muscular legs. beautiful pattern and colors, fit like a glove. however, unfortunately, they felt like pj pants, i know they are beach pants, but they were pretty seethrough. for the price, i decided to return and wait for potential sale... ps i needed heels as they are long if you usually get petite.",4,1,4
31,31,"i really like the soft, flowy satin fabric and vibrant color of this dress! i am 55 125lbs, the s was too large, so i ordered the xs instead. things to note pockets, elastic waistband with nice detailing on the sides, slip underneath, and large flutter sleeves. i think that women with smaller torsos should consider petite sizing.",4,1,5
32,45,"i am a little on the short side, i was afraid it was going to be too long in the back. the sweater is perfect all the way around. i like the looseness in the front and like the way it lays in the back. the color is great.",5,1,0
33,37,"these jeans are amazing! i just got them from retailer the other day and i have worn them almost every day since! i have washed them once. the tag says to turn inside out, wash in cold, and hang dry. i was a little skeptical that they would still be soft without the dryerdryer sheets, but they are wonderful and do not stretch out. i will get lots of use out of them and i just wish they made them in more colors. they are very comfortable i totally love the high rise. they are a little long but i",5,1,1
34,35,i had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be. it was tts i am 53 and usually wear a small. but the material was horribly scratchy. both the body of the top as well as the sleeves. and the design is not all that flattering. it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life!,2,0,0
35,48,"when i saw this online, it looked like a regular cardigan with a hood, but with looser arms and a generally looser fit. just be aware it has bat wings or something not sure what it is called. there is not one picture included with an arm lifted, so without a really close look, the arms look loose, but normal. i returned it ",5,1,5
36,47,"ok, here is the story i am 55, 118 lb, 34c. i got a 4 and a 6, both are s tad tight at the chest and shoulder area, but i have big shoulders i am keeping the 6. there is plenty material at the waist and below, but the dress does not look frumpy, at least on me it does not. i like the picture with the belt and i will wear it that way too. i also like the sleeves, they make it easier to wear at work. the material is lovely and so is the embroidery and cutout. it really is a sweet summer dress",4,1,1

40,48,"this dress is absolutely adorable. runs true to size, i am five foot nine and a medium fit perfect. the denim has a lot of stretch. i cannot wait to wear it in the winter with tights and boots! do not wait too long before this one sells out.",5,1,1
41,58,"i ordered this in white. the material is similar to a polo shirt, which i had not counted on. it was also on the large size and just unflattering on me. still, the quality seemed to be good.",3,1,5
42,45,"this shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. do not waste your time on this shirt. such a shame, it could have been very cute.",1,0,1
43,42,very flattering cut.  very loose  flowy.  runs a little big for a small but fits well for someone who sometimes fits medium depending on the cut.  i need to wear a bralette with this top.,5,1,0
44,38,"in my opinion, for this amount of money, the dress needs to be something really different. and this one is not. it has several structural issues and it seems to have a split personality summery material, dark color, flirty and fun...but overly conservative up top.initially, the top portion is extremely sheer. you are saved a bit by the extra fabric at the front, but it still seemed odd that the top is not lined  particularly for a dress meant for winter.there is too much going on up top. th",3,0,4
45,39,"the stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders, but that was kind of snug, perhaps why it did not fit right, it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose, so it looked big on me, but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big, so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!colors are nice, light, but appropriate for fall or summer! light fabri",3,1,2

47,49,"i remember the first time i walked into an retailer store like walking into a dream of all my favorite things. i have finally found a store whose products help me to express myself. as a writer, i love whimsical  out of the ordinary. i have found my honey hole. every time one of the pastel bags wribbon handles is past over the counter or i push add to cart on my computer, i do a little happy dance in my heart. my closet is like a candy store filled with sweets  treats. thank you retailerp",5,1,0

52,34,i loved this dress so much i got it in 2 colors. i had to send it back twice to get the size right. i ended up with a medium. the fabric was pretty wrinkly on arrival. it is dryclean only. overall it is an easy and relaxed dress appropriate for work but still very cute.,5,1,0
53,23,it is hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size i am a 36dd and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did,3,0,1
54,32,the tank top fits well. i usually boarded between a large and an xl and i got a large in this shirt which was perfect. it is kind of thin material so i wear a white tank under it. it is not too big in the armpits which is nice so my bra does not show. material is really soft and comfortable. it fits loose but not baggy.,4,1,0
55,35,"i thought this was so cute online, sweet and feminine, but when it arrived and i tried it on in my usual 12p i felt like i had just stepped back into freshman year of highschool  it is very early 90s  not the bohemian i was going for. it is also very high waisted, even for my little 51 frame. i truly felt like they pulled this out of someone is closet, dusted it off and said, ta da! as much as i love rachel and monica i have moved on from their clothing ",3,0,43
56,38,"i have this tee in every single color and love it. this shirt is so soft, airy, and comfortable, and the ribbon embellishment on the back dresses it up a little. i love wearing leggings or skinny jeans with it and accessorizing with an infinity scarf. i normally wear a size small, but i sized up to a medium this time. there is very little difference in the two sizes, but i liked the modest increase in length. i am glad that i did this, because the tees shrunk ever so slightly after being in the d",5,1,2
57,26,"i really wanted to love this. sadly, the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back size up maybe even two sizes. secondly, it is see through! a top like this looses it is finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it is very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally, good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the poor mans pineapple top. i could not agree more, sigh. i really did want",3,0,7
58,33,as someone that has many cardigans this one is one of my favs in my collection. i can dress it up or down. it is really soft and great quality. i only wish i had checked if it came in petite since the length is a little long.,5,1,0
59,36,"i got this top in the brown color, although it is really more of a burnt rose, or light sienna shade and it is just lovely. i love the color. the fit is just right, comfortable and a good length. it feels very wellmade and has beautiful details from the pleated collarneckline to the slightly sheer upper back panel. i have only one tiny issue with this top in the very front where it buttons, there is no lining or fabric behind the crocheted lace panels. in retrospect, i can see this slightly",5,1,0
60,54,"this 1960s aprã¨sski style sweater is made of an amazingly soft pure wool in a color that is a touch brighter and maybe even a bit more coral pink than the online photo looks to me. there is a large button under the collar that shows if you stand it up. seems to be of a very high quality, comparable to vintage handknit sweaters..it is very chunky and warm, and i would recommend taking a size up for a looser fit. i am 52, 332537, narrow shoulders, and otth the xs and s fit me well, running",5,1,4

64,56,"this dress was exactly what i was looking for a rich, luxurious fabric, a deep neckline, and a tightly cinched waist. i have a full bust and, while the snug waistband was a negative for some reviewers, for me it is a little miracle. this dress fit like a glove and was flattering in my usual size. thank you!",5,1,0
65,39,i would not be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75 less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they are all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,1,0,10

4964,36,this top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more. buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things.,1,0,0

9978,62,"this immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern, and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though, with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere, and the 2 was still big in the chest, but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas, but the top section just did not work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?",3,0,0
9979,39,"very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual, asymmetrical seam that appears along the front, righthand side of the garment. the model is positioned so that you cannot see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam. i actually like the seam  it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done  there are two layers that form the cowl, and i have found that it means wardrobe malfun",5,1,34
9980,34,this dress is beautiful and flowy but flattering. the colors are vibrant. the slip is tighter than the dress but i do not mind. it is a half slip and the bottom is sheer. i am normally a 1012 in dress and the 12 fit well. the length was good for my 59 height.,4,1,0
9981,36,"i ordered this on a whim during the 40 discount upon sale price. i was a bit worried it looked like a burlap sack initially, but after trying it on with an under tank and leggings i decided it was a keeper. its quite soft and is flattering. i usually wear a medium, got the ml and fits well.",5,1,1

9987,65,i was so excited to see this yellow dress online but was disappointed with the color when it arrived. the yellow us much darker than pictured. i felt the dress ran true to size but if you are short you definitely want to go with petite sizes.,3,0,6
9988,33,"i wish these fit more like joggers, but they are slightly poofier. with the big buttons, i felt a bit too clownish. however, it is a great statement piece if you are up for it. the quality is good and the fabric has a nice texture. i think the problem was that since linen does not drape and scrunch like less structured fabrics, so it holds more volume instead of loose, semiflowy menswear look. i",4,1,1
9989,60,"very attractive and easy to wear. i wore it the night it arrived and wore it again the next night! i love the colors, the pattern and design. this is a stylish tunic sweater. the sleeves are not full length, which i prefer. the sweater is dense  the weave is tight, making the sweater quite warm, but not too warm.",4,1,0
9990,44,it is not as form fitting  hourglass shaped in real life as on the model. i think they must have clipped it in the small of her back so it does not look so boxy. otherwise it is nice.,3,0,0
9991,35,"this shirt is so soft and buttery! it fits tts and just as shown on the model. for the sale price, this shirt is a gonga! good goto shirt on those days where you are just not sure what to wear. one thing that slightly bothers me about this shirt is that the arm holes are a bit loose, so you can see your bra. i think if you wear a black bra with it though, it would be fine.",5,1,3
9992,44,"i bought this at my local retailer store. i bought the last one and when i walked out of the dressing room a lady asked if i was buying it..uh yeah! this is so cute with jeans or pants and booties. i bought the yellow. its lightweight and perfect for work or weekend. i have received many compliments. the arm holes were small for me, i bought a size 6, normally i am a small or xs in most tops. i am 52, 130 lbs, petite and fit, the 6 regular was perfect for me, i was ok with it a little longer.",5,1,0
9993,64,"this dress has a beautiful pattern, and is perfect for work. i wore it with tights recently, but could see wearing it in the summer too the print is versatile enough that it translates. the top layer is sort of a crepe like fabric and there were a lot of strings that needed to be cut that were hanging off. i got many compliments the first time i wore this! i am very curvy and i got the medium and it fits great and is very flattering.",4,1,0

9995,39,"this coat is fun, flirty,  flattering. i bought it strictly for how good it looks on  it is not a coat for warmth. the top is tailored and fitted, but the bottom is very full and swings. there is a lot of fabric on the bottom. i am not sure why some people had a hard time with the sleeves  i do not have the smallest arms and this was not an issue for me. however, i had a very thin shirt underneath the coat and that is all you can fit under it, so keep that in mind. the small fit me perfect. v",5,1,1
