0,42,always attracted to wool for its warmth and breathability. this jacket has great style that can be casual or dressed up some. it is slightly more boxy then expected which i think lends to the casual look. find myself wearing it a lot.,5,1,15
1,34,"i probably should have gone with petite. this dress was just awful on. the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be. it hits me about thigh level. it is very unforgiving, clingy, and shows every bump. i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time, i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy. it is going back.",2,0,4
2,36,"i loved this top when i saw it online, and i still love the idea of it. unfortunately, the execution of the design fell short. i am 54 w a long lean torso. i ordered my usual small, and the arms on the shirt were so long! bc of the way the sides of the top cut up and my 34 d chest, i do not think a petite would work for me. such a cute top, but it just will not work for me.",3,0,1
3,23,"i absolutely love this sweater. it is super soft and the greywhite version is lovely. it is definitely more cropped i am 57, but looks great with high waisted jeans or a pencil skirt. so cozy!",5,1,1
4,30,"i love this top so much that i ordered it in second color. it is shorter but still works with skirts and pants. the material is a fun texture. i did not have any problems with the arm holes, but this may be due to being less full in the bust area.",5,1,0
5,33,"i love this dress! there are so many different looks you can get just by adjusting the straps or shoulders. the material is lightweight and flows with every turn. i ordered my usual size 10 and it fits perfectly. i did need a little assistance in getting the side zip to go up, but once it was on i did not want to take it off.",5,1,0
6,35,"this design looks really sharp on the image, but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyestershiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft, with a gray jersey lining, it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.  i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b, i felt like i was busting out of a size 8, and i am a 34d.",3,0,1
7,55,unusual design and striking color make this the perfect dress this winter season. the fit is flattering and the design makes it perfect for work or play.,5,1,1
8,42,i love the back detail but does not feel that comfortable on. i bought in green. it is fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up. i am 107 and bought xs size. i should have ordered the s.,3,0,0
9,63,i love the pilcro serif legging jeans but these were a big disappointment. if you have any thigh at all do not bother.,2,0,2
10,48,"this is one of the best potential dresses i have seen from retailer, but it needs a doover. i am usually a 12 in this style of dress, but i sized up to a 16 the largest size and could not even button the top. even if i had been able to do so, i would have worn it as a tunic. i am 55 and the largest size would have been a racy mini skirt at best on me if worn as a dress. this dress is fit for only the tiniest and most smallbreasted of people. that said, if the company were to try again ne",3,0,0
11,27,"this is a very flattering pencil skirt. i found it in the store and bought an xs, and have been wearing it to work. it is not too short, and the wrap fit looks great.",5,1,0
12,48,"i got this in the green blue pink motif and i love it. really nice flow and not tent like at all. 58, 135, and in a size 6 i do not find this shows my stomach at all. it is really comfortable and i love the colors. i did get this in store at 15 off and i think it is a little pricy for a rayon shirt without the discount.",5,1,3

14,42,love the cute print and texture of fabric. perfect casual tshirt.,4,1,0
15,58,i looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money. i wear a size 2p. was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress. for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up. the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on thick and heavy. the overall fit was too big and very unflattering.,2,0,4
16,31,"expected them to fit somewhat loose but actually tight for a boyfriend fit. like a slightly relaxed skinny with a really low crotch. stretches everywhere when sitting and walking except the waistband. the distressing and fraying holes in good placement. wish there was some on the back of the leg but i have yet to find a pair that does that. good color and quality, but not quite worth full price. will probably look for them on sale later. i always prefer skinny jeans over boyfriend do it might bi",4,1,3
17,40,"i wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right  the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it is too bad, because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person...",2,0,0
18,42,"i bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it. it came out of the wash delicatecold cycle with 3 small holes. i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer. it is flattering, lightweight, gorgeous color, cool raw edges, vback detail...i could go on and on about all the things i love about this top, but now it has holes after one washing so it is all for naught. doover please with better fabric qa.",2,0,3
19,37,i love this dress for day and night time. the back detail is cute and works well with a racerback bra. it runs big though. i am normally a small in dresses and the arm holes are too big in the size small on me. it was also generally too big all over. i like the length and the weight of the fabric. i purchased in the off black color.,4,1,0
